# CNN
Using pytorch as the deep learning framework
model_training is for the training of GLo-CNN and Loc-CNN
model_finetuning is for the finetuning of GLo-CNN and Loc-CNN
model_validation is for the validation of GLo-CNN and Loc-CNN in multiple iterations, and draw the plot of model performace and the ROC curve.
model_testing is for the calculation of model performance in the split testing set, and the output of DL-biomarkers.
